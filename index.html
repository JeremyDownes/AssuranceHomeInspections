			Assurance Home Inspection Services, LLC. is based on the belief that our customers' needs are of the utmost importance. And we are committed to meeting those needs. Assurance is your one stop all inclusive inspection company, inspectors are licensed by the state of Florida per the NEW 2010/11 regulations including passing the Florida State required National Home inspectors exam, class room and in the field training (with a Florida licensed Home inspector for the required hours), fully bonded (fingerprinted, with full background check) and insured.   Over 30 years combined experience in home inspection and home improvement contracting industry, trained at one of the best schools in the Home inspection industry, AHIT (the American Home Inspectors Training Institute) lead inspector Philip Gaither is a graduate of the Home inspector Master course program, and members of inter-NACHI (full membership, not associate membership) the International Assc. of certified home inspectors. Our home inspections are done to inter-NACHI and AHIT standards, and are above and beyond industry state and national standards. Digital inspection reports are usually delivered within 12-24 hours. Also, beware of inspections companies that offer "smart phone/i-pad" based inspections that are "delivered" on site at the end of the inspection. First of all the software is still in the learning phase for most i-phone or i-pad based reporting software and still have issues and bugs to be worked out (trust us we tried them) And honestly do you really want a "quickie" or "super fast inspection" done when purchasing your future home? One of the largest lifetime investments you might be making? We earn our money the hard way (no short cuts here), we actually work for it!!  We spend our time at the Home focusing on actually inspecting the Home, and its components, we use a top of the line Cannon Camera like professional photographers use (not a cell phone or i-pad or cheap $80 camera) we take an average of 160+ pictures, then back at the office go over all the pictures on a 28" computer monitor, and go thru our notes again (its like doing the inspection twice!!) sure its more work, its more difficult but the result is a much, much better, more detailed inspection. Isn't that what you deserve?

		<p>
			Your peace of mind is our no. 1 priority, and we want to make your inspection as stress free as possible.
 		</p>
 		<p>
			We would welcome the opportunity to earn your trust and deliver to you one of the best home inspections in the industry.
